# ✅ Android Project Ready!

The Android project has been successfully generated!

## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. Make Sure You Have:
- ✅ Android Studio installed
- ✅ An Android emulator created OR physical device connected
- ✅ ANDROID_HOME environment variable set

### 2. Start an Emulator:
- Open Android Studio
- Click "Device Manager"
- Click ▶️ next to your virtual device
- Wait for it to boot completely

### 3. Run the App:
```bash
npx expo run:android
```

This will:
1. Build the app (5-10 minutes first time)
2. Install it on your emulator/device
3. Start the development server
4. Launch the app

## ✅ What to Expect

**First Build:**
- Takes 5-10 minutes
- Downloads dependencies
- Compiles native code

**Subsequent Builds:**
- Much faster (1-2 minutes)
- Only rebuilds changed code

## 🎯 After First Build

Once the app is installed, you can just run:
```bash
npx expo start
```

Then press `a` to open on Android (much faster!)

## 🎉 You're Ready!

Your error handling system is complete and ready to test!

Run: `npx expo run:android`
