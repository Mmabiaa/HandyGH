#  Verification & Validation (V\&V) Plan

## V: Verification (are we building the product right?)

* **Code reviews:** Since solo, use pair programming via recorded PRs or structured checklists for major PRs.
* **Static analysis:** ESLint / Prettier; type checking with TypeScript or mypy if Python.
* **Unit tests:** Jest (Node) or Pytest (Python) for business logic; target >=70% coverage on core modules (booking, payments, auth).
* **Integration tests:** Use test containers / staging env to test DB + API flows (bookings, transactions).
* **Contract tests:** For 3rd-party MoMo API, use mock servers and contract tests to ensure expected payloads.

## V: Validation (are we building the right product?)

* **User acceptance testing (UAT):** Recruit 10–20 pilot providers + 30 customers in one Accra neighborhood to exercise all flows: onboarding, booking, payment, review, dispute.
* **Beta feedback loops:** Collect metrics and qualitative feedback; run 2-week sprints to iterate.
* **Acceptance criteria:** Each FR has pass/fail criteria (see Acceptance Criteria above). UAT sign-off requires: 0 critical defects, ≤3 major defects, performance meets baseline.
