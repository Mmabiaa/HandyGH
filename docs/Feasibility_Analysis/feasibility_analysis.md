# 🔍 Feasibility Analysis

### 1. **Technical Feasibility**

* **Stack & Tools:** Using Next.js/React (frontend), Node.js/Django (backend), PostgreSQL (database), MoMo API (payments) → all mature, widely available, well-documented.
* **Hosting:** Affordable cloud options (Vercel, Render, Railway, AWS free tier).
* **Integration:** Mobile Money APIs in Ghana are available (MTN MoMo has public developer portal).
* **Solo Developer Constraint:** The MVP’s scope (profiles, booking, payment, reviews, admin) is achievable within 3 months by one person with modern frameworks.

✅ **Feasible technically**.

### 2. **Economic Feasibility**

* **Development Cost:**

  * Solo developer → no salaries to pay.
  * Hosting & domain ≈ \$10–20/month.
  * Payment integration costs → MTN MoMo charges transaction fees (absorbed in commission).
* **Revenue Potential:**

  * Commission per booking (5–10%).
  * Premium provider listings.
  * Early adopters in Accra/Kumasi can pay.
* **ROI:** Small investment, potential to generate revenue **immediately upon MVP launch**.

✅ **Economically viable with positive ROI**.

### 3. **Legal Feasibility**

* **Business Registration:** Must register as a company in Ghana (Registrar General’s Dept).
* **Financial Compliance:** Need to comply with Bank of Ghana’s rules for payment services (but since MoMo handles payments, you’re not storing card data → lower burden).
* **Data Protection:** Ghana has a **Data Protection Act (2012, Act 843)** → must protect user data, privacy, and allow opt-out.
* **Global Scaling:** For expansion, need to comply with GDPR (Europe) and similar frameworks.

✅ **Legally feasible with compliance considerations** (data protection + business registration).

---

### 4. **Operational Feasibility**

* **End Users:**

  * Customers: urban professionals already using MoMo, comfortable with digital platforms.
  * Providers: many artisans and service workers use WhatsApp/MoMo already → onboarding is simple.
* **Usability:** Must be **mobile-first** (most users will access via smartphones).
* **Support & Maintenance:** As a solo dev, you’ll handle early maintenance. Later, scale with interns or small team.

✅ **Operationally feasible** if designed mobile-first and onboarding is kept simple.

---

### 5. **Schedule Feasibility**

* **Planned MVP Timeline:** 12 weeks (3 months).
* **Scope:** Achievable in small increments:

  * Week 1–2 → requirements & design.
  * Week 3–5 → auth + provider profiles.
  * Week 6–7 → booking & payment flow.
  * Week 8–9 → reviews + admin.
  * Week 10–12 → testing, UAT, deployment.
* **Solo Developer Risk:** Only risk is slippage if unexpected integration issues (MoMo API delays). Mitigation → start with manual payment confirmation, automate later.

✅ **Feasible within timeline**.

# ✅ Final Verdict on Feasibility

The Gig Marketplace SRS is **feasible across all dimensions**:

* **Technical:** Tools exist, solo dev scope is realistic.
* **Economic:** Low cost, early monetization possible.
* **Legal:** Compliant with Ghana’s data protection & payments laws if designed carefully.
* **Operational:** Fits Ghanaian digital/mobile context, solves real pain points.
* **Schedule:** Achievable within 3 months MVP timeline.

Only caveats:

* Must **document and implement data privacy compliance**.
* Should **phase payment integration** (manual → MoMo API → multiple gateways).
